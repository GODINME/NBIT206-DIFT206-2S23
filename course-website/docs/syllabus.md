## Prerequisites
A solid understanding ofthe theory of how things are stored in the computer, as well as the theory of how a processor executes instructions, as well as a basic understanding of
programming (and specifically programming in C) are the tools you'll need to succeed in this class.


## Course Announcements
All the course announcement and additional materials or tutorials to help you learn the cource will be posted in the blog page of the course website. 


##  Homework late policy
Every assignment in this course is due at exactly the time stated and while I will
grade late assignments, there will be a marks deduction.


## Evaluation
The course evaluation will be a weighted mask score on class attenance and participation, homework, quizes, projects and exams.
